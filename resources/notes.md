* Staplegrove is the site of interest, the other two are provided in case they're useful for training
* "You will notice that this feeder has some negative demand due to this high amount of generation. This will result in reverse flows of energy back up the distribution network" - Irradiance data should be particularly useful for this site
* No outliers have been removed - visual inspection implied no outliers in the validation/test 1-minute data (doesn't mean they're not in the training data)
* staplegrove_1 -> very close, mousehole_3 for the other two
